# First Android With Kotlin Application

This is an android application that uses the github api to fetch all python developers within Kampala.
The application then displays the multiple users ie the usernames and their respective profile images.
On user click, the app opens up an activity that displays the user with more detailed information such as the number of repos,
number of followers and number of accounts followed.

The applocation uses retrofit and okHttp libraries to fetch the users from the github api.
The code is also unit tested (although i must admit, I only did minor tests).
